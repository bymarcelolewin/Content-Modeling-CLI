# Contentful Content Modeling CLI (`ccm`)
Â© Copyright 2025 - Red Pill Blue Pill Studios, LLC - All Rights Reseved.


A CLI tool for **content architects** and **content modelers** working in Contentful. Easily define content types, fields, and relationships using simple, structured JSONâ€”no scripting or programming required. Create reusable componentsâ€”field groups that can include predefined options and default valuesâ€”and use them across multiple content models to ensure consistency and save time. Templatize entire models, and enhance clarity with emoji support through a centralized, easy-to-manage library. Spend less time clicking around the UI and more time designing scalable content models.

## Key Features

- **No-Code Modeling**  
  Define content types, fields, and relationships using simple, structured JSONâ€”no scripting or programming required.

- **Reusable Components**  
  Create reusable field groups (components) that can be shared across content types to reduce duplication and enforce consistency.

- **Default Values in Components**  
  Preconfigure components with predefined options and default values (e.g., a multi-select list with pre-selected defaults) for quick, consistent use in any model.

- **Model Templatization**  
  Clone and reuse complete content models using predefined templates to speed up setup and ensure governance and standards.

- **Emoji Support**  
  Add emojis to your content types and fields from a centralized emoji library to enhance the authoring experience.

- **CMA Configuration per Model**  
  Each model includes its own Contentful configuration file, allowing easy switching between environments, spaces, or projects.

- **Command Line Simplicity**  
  Run all tasks from a single CLI command (`ccm`), making content modeling repeatable, scalable, and versionable (if you, for example, check in your model using Git / GitHub).

- **Extensible Field Type Registry**  
  Your developers can add support for custom field types and embed business logic by extending our modular field registryâ€”making the CLI adaptable to your company's unique modeling requirements.

## Getting Started

- Install Node.js if you don't already have it.
- git pull this repo.  It will create a Contentful-Content-Modeling-CLI folder. 

## CLI Setup
- Switch to "Contentful-Content-Modeling-CLI" folder.
- In your terminal run: ```npm install```
- Then run ```npm link``` or if you get a permission error, run ```sudo npm link```.
- Test the CLI by typing in ```ccm --help``` from anywhere.  CCM should be globally available in your terminal now.

## Create Your First Model
Clone the provided sample content model template using: 

```ccm create-model --model [your-model-name] --template simple-blog --emojis``` 

Once your model is created, swich to the ```Contentful-Content-Modeling-CLI/content-models/[your-model-name]/content-types``` folder and configure the .contentfulrc.json file

```
{
  "managementToken": "your-cma-token-here",
  "activeSpaceId": "your-contentful-space-here",
  "activeEnvironmentId": "your-contentful-environment-here",
  "host": "api.contentful.com"
}
```

You can get the CMA token from Contentful, under the cogwheel -> CMA Tokens.

## Push Your First Model Into Contentful
Be careful with this, as it will make changes to your Contentful space.  We suggest you create a playground environment and push there first.

```ccm push-model --model [your-model-name]```
