# Tutorial: Claude MCP Server Setup

For the MCP server functionality, you need to have installed version 1.0.0-beta.11 or later of the Content Modeling MCP Server and CLI. Older versions do not have the MCP server functionality.

## Starting the MCP Server

To start the MCP server, use:

```bash
cm-mcp-server --project-path /path/to/your/project
```

This command runs the server independently from the CLI tools.
