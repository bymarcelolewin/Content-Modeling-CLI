## Content Models Folder

This folder starts empty. Here is where all your models will live. Best way to start is by cloning an existing template.

You can do this by typing the following in the terminal:

```ccm list-models```

This will give you a list of available templates.

Now you can clone a template with the following command:

```ccm create-model --model [yourmodelname] --template [template-name] --emojis```

You can delete this Readme.md file anytime you want. It's not needed.
